			<img id="bio-image" src="assets/images/elizabeth.png" alt="Elizabeth Prieto">
	
			<p>I was born and raised in South Los Angeles, California. I began my career as a tutor for college-bound 
				students in a local charter school and later became a Resource Specialist Para-educator certified through  
				the Los Angeles Unified School District. Eventually, I worked in education for ten years providing 1-on-1 
				instruction to students with special needs.
			</p>

			<p>It was a great experience to see my student’s academic achievements in the time I spent working with them, but 
				I felt that I needed a new challenge for my own personal growth. The opportunity arose to take a huge risk, 
				move across the country, and dare to dream a new dream. I moved to Durham, North Carolina and attained certification 
				as a Full Stack Web Developer from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s Coding Program Boot Camp in hopes 
				of broadening my skills and exploring new career opportunities.
			</p>

			<p>While moving across the country to pursue a new career has been far from easy, I know that my positive attitude 
				combined with my hard-work ethic will enable me to overcome whatever obstacles life throws my way.
