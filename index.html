			<p>I was born and raised in South Los Angeles, CA. I have a background in education with an emphasis in 1-on-1 instruction to students with special needs. After 28 years of living in Los Angeles and 10 years of working with students, I decided it was time for a change. I moved across the country to Durham, NC in hopes of enhacing and embracing a new life and to explore the opportinities that come with it. 
			</p>

			<p>I began working at schools as a college-bound tutor. I was asked to return and become a Resource Specialist Para-educator and received certification through the Los Angeles Unified School District. In the following years I gained a vast knowledge of learning disabilities within suburban youth. I began as a high school tutor and made my way down to elementary school kids. Being a teacher is a very rewarding career but being an Instructional Assistant was more of my calling. It gave me the ability to support specific students while also being able to float around the classroom giving the other children an extra minute or two that they crave and need.
			</p>

			<p>It was great to see my students progress throughout the time I spent supporting them. I was able to conduct small group learning, lead the classroom when the teacher was absent, and assist the main office during pupil-free days. I gained insight in running and mainting a public school with the various tasks I was given.
			</p>

			<p>Although my job was rewarding, my home life wasn't up to par. That's a story for a blog post. I decided that in order for things to be better and change, that I needed to make it happen. The opportunity arose to move across the country and dare to dream. In the months leading up to the move, I had to dig really deep within myself and remind myself that I deserve all that I want in life. I still have to remind myself and encourage myself to keep swimming and work hard because I want to look back at my life and proudly say "I did that!"
